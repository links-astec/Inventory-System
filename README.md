# Inventory Management System - Backend Design

## Overview

This is the backend design plan for a simple yet robust Inventory Management System targeted at small-scale sellers. The system is built using **Django** and **PostgreSQL**, following best practices for scalability, maintainability, and transparency.

As part of a group project, this document outlines the backend architecture, database models, services, and notifications system.

## üì¶ Technologies Used

* **Backend Framework:** Django (Python 3.x)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Architecture Pattern:** MVC (Django)
* **Notification Channels:** In-Web & SMS
* **Stock Management:** Automated via Service Layer

* Auto-reduces product quantity via service layer.

| Field            | Type        | Notes                  |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| user             | ForeignKey  | Seller                 |

| total\_price     | Decimal     | Auto-calculated        |
| date\_sold       | DateTime    | Sale timestamp         |

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ StockLog (Audit Trail)

Tracks every inventory change automatically.

| Field             | Type       | Notes                           |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |

| is\_read    | Boolean    | Whether notification read |
| created\_at | DateTime   | Timestamp                 |

## üõ†Ô∏è Business Logic: Service Layer Approach

All critical backend operations (stock adjustments, notifications) are handled via a centralized **Service Layer** for consistency and scalability.

Example Service Function:

```python
def adjust_product_stock(product, change_amount, change_type, user, note=""):
    product.quantity += change_amount
    product.save()

    StockLog.objects.create(
        user=user,
        product=product,
        change_type=change_type,
        quantity_changed=change_amount,
        note=note
    )

    if product.quantity < LOW_STOCK_THRESHOLD:
        notify_user(user, f"Product '{product.name}' is low on stock ({product.quantity} left).")
```

---

## üîî Notifications System

### In-Web Notifications:

* Stored in the `Notification` model.
* Displayed on the user‚Äôs dashboard.
* Mark-as-read functionality supported.

### SMS Notifications:

* SMS gateway integration (e.g. Twilio, Africa‚Äôs Talking).
* Used for:

  * Stock low alerts
  * New sales notifications
  * Manual stock adjustments

Notification Service Function:

```python
def notify_user(user, message):
    # In-Web Notification
    Notification.objects.create(user=user, message=message)

    # SMS Notification
    if user.profile.phone_number:
        send_sms(user.profile.phone_number, message)
```

## üìä Key System Flow

| Event                       | Automated Actions                                       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sale recorded (Transaction) | Reduce stock, create StockLog, notify user if stock low |
| Manual stock adjustment     | Update stock, create StockLog, notify user              |
| Product soft-deleted        | Mark inactive, optional notification                    |
| Stock below threshold       | Create in-web + SMS notification                        |

---
